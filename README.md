============

Goal is to learn JavaScript, the right way, with claims cross-examined (tested) using Jasmine. To be more precise, the goal is not to learn everything JavaScript as a language offers. I am targeting only selective, effective, good, functional parts of the language.

Folloiwng are the books, I am refering.

1. JavaScript : The Definitive Guide 
2. JavaScript : The Good Parts 
3. Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja

Couple of more books, I would like to refer are... 

1. Functional JavaScript (I am eagerly waiting for a copy of this book.) 
2. Effective JavaScript

I have following setup, but none is essential, there are other options to achive the same.

1. Fedora 18 (will be moved to 19), 
2. Node.JS, 
3. NPM and 
4. Jasmine-Node
