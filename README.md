js-jazz-mine - JavaScript with Jasmine...
============

Goal is to learn JavaScript, the right way, with various language constructs cross-examined (tested) using Jasmine. To be more precise, the goal is not to learn everything that JavaScript as a language offers. Selectively, the target is limited to functional, good and effective parts of the language.

Folloiwng are the books, I am refering.

1. JavaScript : The Definitive Guide 
2. JavaScript : The Good Parts 
3. Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja

Couple of more books, I would like to refer are... 

1. Functional JavaScript (I am eagerly waiting for a copy of this book.) 
2. Effective JavaScript

I have following setup, but none is essential, there are other options to achive the same.

1. Fedora 18 (will be moved to 19)
2. Node.JS
3. NPM
4. Jasmine-Node (for testing JavaScripts based on RSpec/BDD)
5. EMACS
6. FireFox 21.0 with Firebug

#####Note: 

1. Contrary to the Jasmine suggestion, most of the times, source code is written in the "spec" folder itself for ease.
2. Further plan is to elaborate code-commets, to be more explanatory.
