============

Goal is to learn JavaScript, the right way, with claims cross-examined (tested) using Jasmine.

Q: But how to determine the Way chosen will be the Right way?
A: Well, I looked to the sky; to be precise, to the Cloud and got the clues!!! Folloiwng are the books, I am refering.

JavaScript : The Definitive Guide
JavaScript : The Good Parts
Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja

Couple of more books, I would like to refer are...
Functional JavaScript (I am eagerly waiting for a copy of this book.)
Effective JavaScript


Q: Learn JavaScript? Means?
A: Just language, nothing else. Not everything of the language, only selective, effective, good, functional parts. 

Q: Why?
A: Why? :) The clue is in the referenced books.

Q: What about Jasmine?
A: Jasmine is a JavaScript testing tool based on RSpec/BDD. 

Q: What's the setup?
A: Fedora 18 (will be moved to 19), Node.JS, NPM and Jasmine-Node - none is essential, there are other options available.
