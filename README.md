js-jazz-mine - JS with Jasmine & JSHint...
============

Goal is to learn good, functional and effective parts of the JavaScript language. And test the language constructs with Jasmine (for BDD) and JSHint (for static code analysis). Sort of "JavaScript Koan", my own way.

Following are the books, I am refering.

1. JavaScript : The Definitive Guide - David Flanagan
2. JavaScript : The Good Parts - Douglas Crockford
3. Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja - John Resig & Bear Bilbeault

Couple of more books, I would like to refer are... 

1. Functional JavaScript - Michael Fogus
2. Effective JavaScript - David Herman

I have following setup, but none is essential, there are other options to achive the same.

1. Fedora
2. Node.JS, NPM, Jasmine-Node (for testing JavaScripts based on RSpec/BDD), JSHint (for static code analysis)
3. EMACS/Sublime
4. FireFox with Firebug

#####Note: 

1. Contrary to the Jasmine convention, source code is written within the spec files, for ease.
2. I will keep on refining my knowledge and the content, here-in.
